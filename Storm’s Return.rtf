\cf0 Commander Garrett sat beside Captain Korven from the Adventurers Guild, their tactical discussion punctuated by occasional disagreements about supply lines. War- Mage Theron consulted with a group of magical specialists about the feasibility of long-range portal networks.\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 At the head table, Elder Maerath studied a detailed map of Elstirlan with the intensity of someone who had been memorizing enemy positions for decades.\

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Riley had spent years fighting his storm heritage, and in finally embracing it, he found perfect harmony between human will and elemental force.\

\cf0 From the ship\'92s deck came screams\'97not of pain, but of terror as cultists caught sight of what approached them through the storm. Some threw themselves into the harbor rather than face the wrath of a storm lord in full fury.\

\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \'93Oh, hey there,\'94 Lillian said casually, stepping over an unconscious cultist as she made her way toward Riley.

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Taelysin approached the group with his characteristic ancient calm. He\'92d been quietly observing the reunions and strategic discussions, but now his presence commanded immediate attention.\

\cf0 \'93The coordination between our forces here and those moving from Aerthalen is excellent,\'94 he said, studying the tactical projections with approval. \'93But there\'92s some- thing else we need to address.\'94\

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The war was over,\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Volcryn was defeated, and just one week ago they had all stood in the restored throne room watching Lillian\'92s coronation as Queen of Elstirlan, with Riley crowned as her King Consort.\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1

\cf0 \'93Are you absolutely certain about this?\'94 Lord Regent Aldric had asked when they announced their wedding plans.\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The former king had stepped down from the throne to serve as Lillian\'92s chief advisor,\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-4

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 He wore the same deep blue formal attire he\'92d donned for the coronation, but his boots were still the practical ones he\'92d worn during their underground days.\

\cf0 \'93I still can\'92t quite believe we chose to do this in a cave,\'94 Elena murmured as Anna helped her adjust her wedding dress\'97a beautiful gown she\'92d been able to choose freely, without worrying about what could be acquired through resistance contacts. \'93Though after a week of formal court functions, this feels wonderfully\'85 us.\'94\

\cf0 \'93Speaking of normal,\'94 Elena said with a mischievous expression, \'93have you no- ticed that certain long-married monarchs seem to be causing interesting weather pat- terns in the palace\'92s royal wing?\'94\

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 you\'92d think Riley would have better control,\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 but Lillian keeps insisting it\'92s just \'91co- incidental atmospheric disturbances.\'92\'94\
\'93The servants have been talking for days,\'94 Elena laughed. \'93Apparently yesterday morning there was a localized thunderstorm that lasted exactly twenty-three minutes and was confined entirely to the royal chambers.\'94\

\cf0 \'93That\'92s nothing,\'94 Anna said with a wicked grin. \'93You should have seen the storms in Aerthalen. Back when Riley couldn\'92t control it properly, he once accidentally creat- ed a localized blizzard that buried half the training grounds.

\'93Or social healing,\'94 Cedric added thoughtfully. \'93Marcus, do you realize what you just did for that young guard?

\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb6\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Guardian Senna nodded approvingly. \'93Soul warriors are often called upon to serve as healers of the spirit as much as defenders against corruption.\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-11

\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb8\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Most importantly,\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-3
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 she revealed how soul warriors could serve as spiritual beacons during reality-warping attacks, providing stable points of identity and purpose that prevented allies from becoming lost in dimensional confusion.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri333\sl350\slmult1\sb87\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93When the Void Seekers attack,\'94 she explained gravely, \'93they don\'92t just try to kill their enemies\'97they try to make them forget who they are, what they\'92re fighting for, why their relationships matter. A soul warrior can anchor those memories, those con- nections, keeping an army functioning as a cohesive force even when reality itself is being rewritten around them.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri346\sl350\slmult1\sb7\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Marcus felt his tactical mind racing with possibilities. \'93You\'92re describing a form of warfare where spiritual resilience is as important as physical strength.\'94\

\cf0 \'93Changed,\'94 Marcus replied honestly. \'93For twelve years, I\'92ve been carrying guilt over helping my uncle break the bonds between people. Today I learned that I have the ability to heal and strengthen those same bonds. It\'92s\'85 overwhelming.\'94\
\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb4\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 \'93And necessary,\'94 Senna said gently. \'93The Void Seekers represent the ultimate ex- pression of the corruption your uncle embraced\'97the desire to unmake all connec- tions, to reduce existence to isolated fragments with no meaning or purpose. They\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw40

\cf0 Trevor\'92s earth magic responded, stone erupting from the ground to pin the now- tangible void scout in place. Marcus maintained his spiritual anchor, feeling the crea- ture\'92s attempts to erase their memories sliding off the reinforced connections be- tween the Nine like water off steel.\

\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb87\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The sprite\'92s chaotic fighting style proved devastatingly effective against the crys- talline creature. Every swing of his axe found gaps in its defenses that shouldn\'92t have existed, every dodge took him to safety through paths that defied logic.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb4\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 But it was the combination of Lillian and Riley that turned the tide. Her Dawnfire continued to build reality around the creature while his storm magic provided the at- mospheric density and electrical charge that made creation magic more potent. To- gether, they were forcing the void scout to exist so thoroughly that it couldn\'92t retreat back into nothingness.\

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 empty lots filled back in with forgotten buildings, and the fundamental wrongness of the place began to fade.\

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Marcus felt the spiritual anchors strain as reality rippled around them, the creature\'92s death throes threatening to unmake their very existence.\

\cf0 Riley\'92s storm-charged atmosphere held the creature in place while Lillian\'92s Dawn- fire continued building reality around it faster than it could dissolve. Lyric\'92s axe found the creature\'92s core in that moment of vulnerability, his chaotic precision guided by some instinct that had nothing to do with strategy and everything to do with perfect, impossible timing.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li337\fi432\ri340\sl350\slmult1\sb87\qj\partightenfactor0

\cf0 \'93That,\'94 Lillian panted, letting her Dawnfire fade as Riley released his hold on the atmosphere, \'93was the hardest thing I\'92ve ever created. Building reality around some- thing that actively resists existence\'85\'94\
\'93But we did it,\'94 Riley said with satisfaction, small sparks still dancing between his fingers. \'93The atmospheric enhancement worked\'97made your creation magic more \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2

\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \'93New technique learned,\'94 Elena observed, her analytical mind already cataloging what they\'92d discovered. \'93Force manifestation through combined creation and atmos- pheric magic.\'94\
\'93And it\'92s repeatable,\'94 Cedric added,\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 his divine light still glowing softly around the area. \'93My consecration magic can weaken them, Dorian can heal the damage they cause, but you two can make them vulnerable to conventional attack.\'94\
As Millhaven finished snapping back into full reality around them\'97buildings reap- pearing, people stepping out of houses that had been gaps moments before, the marketplace filling with vendors who suddenly remembered their purpose\'97the Nine stood victorious.\

\cf0 But this time, something was different. As their dragon forms took shape, the bond between them\'97forged through months of marriage, strengthened by countless battles, deepened by absolute trust\'97created a resonance that neither had experi- enced before.\
Where Lillian\'92s opal scales caught the crystalline light, Riley\'92s storm-touched hide reflected it back in patterns that seemed to dance between realities. When Riley\'92s lightning flickered across his wings, Lillian\'92s dragon fire responded in harmonious waves that amplified rather than competed.\

Below them, Trevor had reached the foundation chamber\'97a vast space carved from a single crystal formation that pulsed with the heartbeat of the entire realm. As his hands touched the crystalline surface,\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 his earth magic expanded beyond anything he had ever experienced.\
